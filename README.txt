#Learning Modern OpenGL

I have been using intermediate mode for Opengl for years now. I want to switch to the new version using the new pipeline.
In this repo you will find source code of me learning the modern pipeline from http://www.open.gl/ page and personal examples/learning code. All credits go to Alexander for making that site.

Files going with the tutorial:
	-Context_Creation.cpp
	-Drawing_Polygons.cpp
	-Textures.cpp
	-Transformations.cpp

Personal examples:
	-Moving_Around.cpp
